# 🧠 Deep-Learning-Zoo

Welcome to the **Deep Learning Zoo** —  
a curated, hands-on collection of deep neural architectures I’ve studied, dissected, and experimented with.

🦁 Whether it’s a vision beast, a language dragon, or an audio chimera, every model has its own cage in this zoo.

## 📚 Purpose

- To systematically organize all models I’ve seriously explored and reproduced  
- To provide explanations, paper links, visualizations, and clean implementations  
- To build a long-term neural model knowledge base for future reference and growth
